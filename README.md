# About

GovTuffyToken is a BEP20 standard token created by the CSUF Blockchain club. These governance tokens will be rewarded to those who contribute to the creation and development of TuffyToken projects. The tokens will serve as a means of voting on proposed club projects/activities. Thus, the more involved a contributor is, the more tokens they will hold, and the more weight their vote will carry.

## Token Management

GovTuffyToken will employ crypto custody solutions to secure a vault wallet. We will use BitGo or similar custody service which requires K out of N signatures to use the fund locked in custody. The custody service, the faculty advisors, the club president, the treasurer will each hold a signature.

## Distribution

Initial distribution of tokens will be manual. Contribution rewards will be allocated and approved by those holding custody signatures to the vualt wallet.
